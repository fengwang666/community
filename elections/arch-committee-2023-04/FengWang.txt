Background:

Iâ€™m a software engineer at Confluent, where I work at the compute platform team.
I became involved in the Kata Containers project since August 2021 and have been
an active contributor and community member since then.

Over the past two years, I have contributed extensively to the Kata Containers
project, including enabling non-root VMM support, support direct-volume mount,
and fixed a number of critical bugs. Through these contributions, I have
developed a deep understanding of the project and have gained valuable experience
working with the Kata Containers community.

My main motivation is to improve the production adoption of the project by making
it more stable, performant, production mature and accessible. Kata Containers as
the leading sandboxed container runtime has its unique position in the cloud
native world. However, based on my last two years of experience working at two
different companies trying to adopt Kata Containers in production, there still
remain many challenges for companies to adopt Kata Containers in production,
especially for small size companies. Thanks to its compatability with runtime shim
interface, onboarding a workload to Kata Containers is relatively simple, but the
effort to operate it in production is nontrivial. As a community, we can focus more
on improving the production quality, ease of operation, and community support.
